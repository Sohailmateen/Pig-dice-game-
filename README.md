# 🎲 Pig Game

Welcome to the **Pig Game**! This is a classic dice game implemented in Python, designed for single-player mode but can easily be expanded to multiplayer. The objective of the game is to reach **100 points** before rolling a 1, which ends your turn and forfeits any points you haven’t held.
